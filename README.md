# ucmpi_os

This is the open source repo to build the UCMPi/OS.

## What's this all about

alphaWerk and Cytech collaborated in the development of a UCM for the Comfort range of Alarm / Home Automation systems to embed a Raspberry Pi.

This repo is an open source licensed version of the original Beta software which is now being retired in favour of this new open source version.
